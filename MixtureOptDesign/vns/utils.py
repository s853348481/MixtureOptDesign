    """
    Generate a simplex lattice design for q components and m levels.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    q : int
        The number of components in the design.
    m : int
        The number of equally spaced levels for each component.

    Returns:
    --------
    design : numpy.ndarray, shape (n_points, q)
        A 2-dimensional array of design points with n_points rows and q columns.

    Notes:
    ------
    The values in the resulting array are the proportions of each component and are equally spaced between 0 and 1.

    Generate an initial design by selecting k points randomly from a given lattice design, allocate those points randomely  in a design of shape (q,j,s) with s choice sets with j alternatives based on all possible combination of points k of size.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    lattice_design : numpy array
        A 2D numpy array of shape (n, q), representing the lattice design where n is the number
        of points in the canditate sets and q is the number of ingredients.
    j : int, optional
        The number of alternatives in each choice set. Default is 2.
    s : int, optional
        The number of choice sets to create. Default is 16.
    k : int, optional
        The number of of distinct point inthe design
    
    Returns
    -------
    numpy array
        intial design with shape (q,j,s)
   
    numpy array
        lattice points, k random points from lattice design that are included in the initial design with shape (k, p)
        
    numpy array
        other points not included in the initial design  with shape (n-k, p), where n is the total number of points in the lattice design and k is the number of lattice points included in the construction of the initial design.
        
    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If j is less than 2 or greater than k.
    
    Notes
    -----
    This function uses the numpy.random.choice function to select k points randomly from the given
    lattice design, and the itertools.combinations function to generate all possible combinations
    of j points from the k points. Then, a random subset of s choice sets are selected from the
    generated combinations.
